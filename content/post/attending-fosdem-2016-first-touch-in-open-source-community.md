FOSDEM 2016 happened at the end of January, but I have been too busy to write my first trip to an open source event.

FOSDEM takes place in Belgium, which is almost ten thousand kilometers from my home. Luckily, Google kindly offered sponsorship for traveling to Belgium and lodging places for former GSoC mentors and students in Debian, which made my travel possible without giving my dad headaches. Thank you Google!

Open source meetings are really fun. Imagine you have been working hard on an exciting project with several colleagues around the world who have never met you, and now you have a chance to meet them and make friends with them, cool! However I am not involved with any project too deeply, so I don't have too much expectations on this. But I'm still excited when I first saw my mentor Hans-Christoph Steiner! Pity that we forgot to take a picture, as I'm not those kind of people who like to take selfies every day.

One of the most interesting projects I saw during FOSDEM is [Ring](https://ring.cx). Ring is a distributed communication software without central servers. All Ring clients in the world are connected to several others and find a particular user using a distributed hashtable. A Ring client is a key pair, whose public key serves as the ID. Thus, Ring is anti-censorshiping, anti-eavesdropping, which is great for China citizens and feared by the China government. After I got home I knew another similar but older project [Tox](https://tox.chat), which seems to more feature-rich than Ring but still not sufficient for promoting it. There's a huge disadvantage of both project, which is high battery drainage on Android. Hope someday they will improve it.

At the end of FOSDEM I joined the volunteers to do the clean up. We cleaned all the buildings, restored the rooms and finally shared the dinner at the hall of K Building. I'm not a European so I didn't talk too much to them, but this is really an unforgettable experience. Hope I can join the next FOSDEM soon.
